## Data Wrangling, Exploration, Visualization

### Caroline Cummings, cac7659

#### Introduction 

When the Agricultural Revolution began in the 1940s, it initiated a global switch from small-scale subsistence farming to large-scale industrialized agriculture. As a result, humans have increasingly deforested and encroached upon natural lanscapes. Agricultural expansion is a leading driver of deforestation, and livestock prodution in particularly destructive because it requires a significant amount of land both to provide livestock space to live and to grow feed stock. In fact, cattle is the leading cause of deforestation in the Amazon and a majority of soy production in this region is used to feed cattle instead of humans. Agricultural expansion and intensification has also had negative implications on infectious disease emergence and spread. Land-use change is a major driver of the emergence of new infectious diseases and it can exacerbate the prevalence of endemic pathogens. Malaria cases is shown to increase when deforestation occurs due to a phenomenon called the "edge effect." When forests are fragmented (due to land-use change such as deforestation and agriculture), the wildlife-livestock-human interface can become disrupted and lead to ecosystem imbalances. Wildlife, livestock, and humans come in contact with each other more frequently and interact in abnormal ways due to increased surface area between natural and human-changed land. In areas where there is a significant forest edge, malaria incidence is shown to increase because a) an increased number of people become available food sources for mosquitoes, b) animals that usually serve as food sources to mosquitoes die or become displaced due to habitat loss, and c) forest edges provide suitable habitat for mosquitos. 

I chose to analyze datasets that contained the malaria cases per 100,000 people, percent of land used for agriculture, percent of land that is covered by forest, and the livestock production index for countries between the years 1995-2005 to see if there is a relationship between these variables (4 datasets total). The csv files for the datasets came from GapMinder. I expect for malaria cases, agricultural land, and livestock production to increase over time and for the forest cover to decrease. Understanding the relationship between these variables is especially important now as medical resources have shifted away from  prevention and treatment programs for endemic dieases, such as malaria, due to the reallocation of resources to combat COVID-19. 

```{R}
# read your datasets in here, e.g., with read_csv()
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

agriculture<-read_csv("agriculture.csv")

forest<- read_csv("forest.csv")

livestock <- read_csv("livestock.csv")

forest_coverage <- read_csv("forest_coverage.csv")

malaria_prop <- read_csv("malaria_prop.csv")
```

#### Tidying: Reshaping

If your datasets are tidy already, demonstrate that you can reshape data with pivot wider/longer here (e.g., untidy and then retidy). Alternatively, it may be easier to wait until the wrangling section so you can reshape your summary statistics. Note here if you are going to do this.

For all 4 datasets, I used pivot_longer to create a column for the year variable for the years between 1995-2005. I used select to only pull data on my ID variable, the years 1995-2005, and the malaria/land-use data. My ID variable is "country," so to prevent the "year" column from duplicating when I joined the 4 datasets, I united the country and year columns. Also, I used an underscore to combine these data because if I used a space, it would be difficult to separate these data back into "country" and "year" because some countries are more than one word (ex: Papua New Guinea).

```{R}
# your tidying code (if applicable; can also wait until wrangling section)

#Demonstration that I can use pivot wider/longer:
tidy_forest<- forest_coverage %>% pivot_longer(c("1995":"2005"), names_to="year", values_to="forest_cover") %>% select(country, year, forest_cover)
tidy_forest %>% pivot_wider(names_from="year", values_from="forest_cover")

#Data used:
#Forest: The percent of a country's total land area that is covered in forest each year
forest_coverage1 <- forest_coverage %>% pivot_longer(c("1995":"2005"), names_to="year", values_to="forest_cover") %>% select(country, year, forest_cover)
new_forest<- forest_coverage1 %>% unite(country, year, col="country_year", sep="_")

#Malaria: malaria cases per 100,000 people each year
malaira_prop1 <- malaria_prop %>% pivot_longer(c("1995":"2005"), names_to="year", values_to="malaria") %>% select(country, year, malaria)
new_malaria_prop <-malaira_prop1 %>% unite(country, year, col="country_year", sep="_")

#Agriculture: the percent of a country's total land area that used for permanently for crops or pasture
agriculture1 <- agriculture %>% pivot_longer(c("1995":"2005"), names_to="year", values_to="agriculture") %>% select(country, year, agriculture)
new_agriculture <-agriculture1 %>% unite(country, year, col="country_year", sep="_")

#Livestock: An index that provides a measure of livestock production outputs (meat, milk, etc.) for a country each year
livestock1 <- livestock %>% pivot_longer(c("1995":"2005"), names_to="year", values_to="livestock") %>% select(country, year, livestock)
new_livestock <- livestock1 %>% unite(country, year, col="country_year", sep="_")

```

    
#### Joining/Merging

```{R}
# your joining code
first_join<- inner_join(new_forest, new_malaria_prop, by="country_year")
second_join<- inner_join(new_agriculture, new_livestock, by="country_year")
final_join <- inner_join(first_join, second_join, by="country_year")

#separate country and year
final_join<- final_join %>% separate("country_year", into=c("country", "year"), sep="_")

#total rows in each dataset
glimpse(forest_coverage)
glimpse(malaria_prop)
glimpse(agriculture)
glimpse(livestock)

#unique IDs in each dataset
n_distinct(forest_coverage)
n_distinct(malaria_prop)
n_distinct(agriculture)
n_distinct(livestock)

#IDs that appear in one dataset but not the other
anti<- forest_coverage %>% anti_join(malaria_prop, by="country")
anti %>% summarize(n_distinct(country))
head(anti)


#IDs that the datasets have in common
final_join %>% summarize(n_distinct(country))

#Additional code for discussion
malaria_prop %>% anti_join(final_join, by="country")
n_distinct(forest_coverage)- final_join %>% summarize(n_distinct(country))

```
Process:
I joined all 4 datasets together using inner_join. I chose to use inner_join because allowed me to keep only the data that had a match for each country in the years between 1995 and 2005. Thus, if the livestock data did not include an entry for Angola, then Angola would not be included in the final dataset. After I joined all the data together, I used separate to split the "country_year" variable into "country" (the ID variable) and "year." In the end, I had six variables in total (country, year, percent of land that is covered in forest compared to total land area (forest_cover), percent of land that is used for agriculture compared to total land area (agriculture), livestock production index (livestock), and malaria (malaria cases per 100,000 people)).

Calculations Discussion: There are 230 rows in the forest dataset, 107 rows in the malaria dataset, 211 rows in the agriculture dataset, and 202 rows in the livestock dataset. The number of distinct IDs is the same for each dataset because there are no duplicate data points of the countries. There are 123 IDs in the forest dataset that are missing in the malaria dataset, which indicates that 123 countries are not included in the malaria dataset but are present in the forest data. This includes Aruba and the Netherlands Antilles. As demonstrated by the final inner_join between the 4 datasets ("final_join"), the datasets have 106 ID variables in common. In other words, there are 106 countries that appear in all 4 datasets. The size of the final joined data is about half of the size of original datasets, except for the malaria data. Only one country, French Guiana, appeared in the malaria dataset but not the final joined dataset. Based on the forest data, I've lost 124 ID variables. Losing data points could have a negative impact on the analyses of these data because the results are less likely to be representative of the real world. Additionally, having a large sample size is important to reduce the margin of error and to decrease how much outliers can skew the data. Therefore, I have an increased risk of having resuts that are inaccurate and less representative of trends that are actually happening in the real world.


####  Wrangling

```{R}
# your wrangling code
#convert variables to numeric
final_join$year <-as.numeric(as.character(final_join$year))
final_join$malaria <- as.numeric(sub("k", "e3", final_join$malaria, fixed= TRUE))

#reorganize data
final_join<- final_join %>% select(country, year, forest_cover, agriculture, everything())

```

```{R}
#Summary Statistics Demonstration
library(knitr)

#Average number of malaria cases (per 100,000 people) for each country across 1995-2005
final_join %>% group_by(country) %>% na.omit() %>% summarize(mean_malaria=mean(malaria)) %>% arrange(desc(mean_malaria))
final_join %>% group_by(country) %>% na.omit() %>% summarize(mean_malaria=mean(malaria)) %>% filter(country=="China")
updated_join<- final_join %>% group_by(country) %>% na.omit() %>% mutate(mean_malaria=mean(malaria))
